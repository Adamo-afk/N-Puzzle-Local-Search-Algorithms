# N-Puzzle-Local-Search-Algorithms
Description:
The N-Puzzle Solver with Local Search Algorithms is an exciting project that tackles the classic N-Puzzle problem using various local search techniques. The N-Puzzle, also known as the sliding puzzle, is a well-known problem where a board with N tiles arranged in an NxN grid has one empty space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial state to a goal state by sliding the tiles into the empty space.
This project aims to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of local search algorithms in finding solutions for N-Puzzle instances. Local search methods are heuristic-based techniques that iteratively improve the current solution by making small changes, exploring neighboring states, and selecting the best moves based on an evaluation function. The goal is to find an optimal solution while navigating the large search space efficiently.
