# N-Puzzle-Local-Search-Algorithms
Description:
The N-Puzzle-Local-Search-Algorithms project solves the classic N-Puzzle problem using various local search techniques. The N-Puzzle, also known as the sliding puzzle, is a well-known problem where a board with N tiles arranged in an NxN grid has one empty space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial state to a goal state by sliding the tiles into the empty space.
This project aims to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of local search algorithms such as Beam Search, Generalized Limited Discrepancy Search, and Beam Search with Limited Discrepancy Backtracking in finding solutions for N-Puzzle instances. Local search methods are heuristic-based techniques that iteratively improve the current solution by making small changes, exploring neighboring states, and selecting the best moves based on an evaluation function. The goal is to find an optimal solution while navigating the large search space efficiently.
